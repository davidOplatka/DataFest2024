This repository hosts the code for team Byte Wizards in UCLA's 2024 DataFest Competition. Our team members are:

* Jacob Bianchi
* Leo Cardozo
* Gregor MacDonald
* David Oplatka
* Samuel Perrott

Our team analyzed large data sets and web scraped an online sample textbook to identify students' weakest concepts and craft personalized practice questions for CourseKata's online statistics textbooks.
We sought to improve students' learning by transforming CourseKata's static textbook design into an adaptive learning system that could greatly improve students' learning and user experience with CourseKata's content.

We also developed a custom chat bot that uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based on the sample textbook so students can ask questions about important topics they may not understand from simply reading the textbook content.

Please check out all branches of this repository to see the full work of our amazing team!
